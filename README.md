# crime_rank

This is my adaptation of the learning to rank algorithm for space-time event hotspot ranking, known as CrimeRank, initially introduced by Mohler et al. (2020).
While the original implementation was done in MATLAB, I have implemented it in Python for this study. Besides adjusting the parameters to suit the context of Mexico City, I have also made efficiency enhancements to the original code, ensuring the approachâ€™s integrity remains intact.
For more comprehensive insights, I recommend referring to the original repository: https://github.com/gomohler/crimerank/tree/master

To run:
1. feature_engineering
2. run_crime_rank
